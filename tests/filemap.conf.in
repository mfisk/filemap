# Determine number of items to run concurrently based on CPU and I/O load.
# The value is the minimum amount of time (in seconds) after a new process is 
# started before determining if the system still has headroom for more.
# Set to 0/False/None in order to use static scheduling.
#
# Default: dynamicload = 2.0

#
# If not using dynamic load scheduling (see above) each node will run 
# up to <processes> total concurrent processes shared across all concurrent jobs.  
# Each job is further limited to (<cpusperjob> * <procspercpu>) processes.
# <procspercpu> is a job-specific argument for "fm map" and defaults to 1.  
# By default that limit is 1 process per node and is appropriate for I/O bound
# jobs.  For CPU-bound jobs on multicore nodes, either change these settings
# or let dynamicload be set in order to automatically add processes until the node is
# busy.   
# 
# Default: processes = 1000
# Default: cpusperjob = 1

# Directory used for synchronization files.
# Must be globally accessible from Nodes (but not necessarily this client machine)

# not necessarily this client machine. If the location is mounted in different 
# locations on nodes, override the setting in node definitions.

# FM command (specify alternate path)
# Note: Many versions of SSH will not execute your .login equivalent,
# so all commands must be explicitly referenced or in a PATH in your

#
# PYTHON command (specify alternate path)
# The fm script will be executed under the interpreter specified here.
# Default: python = python

# python = python3

# SSH command (specify alternate path or options)
# Note: for reduce operations to function, credential or agent forwarding must work
# Note: older versions of rsync don't support quoted arguments in the ssh command
# For improved performance use -S
# Default: ssh = ssh -o GSSAPIDelegateCredentials=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -Ax

## List your nodes here.
## The [Nodename] should be unique, but is not used.
## If a 'hostname' is specified, then this is a remote host and 
## the given hostname must be accessible from all nodes.
