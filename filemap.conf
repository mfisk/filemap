# Determine number of items to run concurrently based on CPU and I/O load.
# The value is the minimum amount of time (in seconds) after a new process is 
# started before determining if the system still has headroom for more.

#
# If not using dynamic load scheduling (see above) each node will run 
# up to <processes> total concurrent processes shared across all concurrent jobs.  
# Each job is further limited to (<cpusperjob> * <procspercpu>) processes.
# <procspercpu> is a job-specific argument for "fm map" and defaults to 1.  
# By default that limit is 1 process per node and is appropriate for I/O bound
# jobs.  For CPU-bound jobs on multicore nodes, either change these settings
# or let dynamicload be set in order to automatically add processes until the node is
# busy.

# PYTHON command (specify alternate path)
# The fm script will be executed under the interpreter specified here.

# Note: for reduce operations to function, credential or agent forwarding must work
# Note: older versions of rsync don't support quoted arguments in the ssh command

## List your nodes here.
## The [Nodename] should be unique, but is not used.
## If a 'hostname' is specified, then this is a remote host and 
## the given hostname must be accessible from all nodes.
## Most of the global settings can be over-ridden with per-node values.

## Reference elements of the list using Python "replacement field" syntax
## In this example hostnames are formatted node0001 - node1000 so we have to zero-pad the hostnames
