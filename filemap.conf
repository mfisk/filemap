## Global defaults: (can be overridden per node)

#
# How many processes to run simulatenously per node

# Default: cpusperjob = 1

# Directory used for synchronization files.
# Must be globally accessible from Nodes (but not necessarily this client machine)
# and coherent, but need not be large or fast. This path is relative to the Nodes, 
# not necessarily this client machine. If the location is mounted in different 
# locations on nodes, override the setting in node definitions.

# FM command (specify alternate path)
# Note: Many versions of SSH will not execute your .login equivalent,
# so all commands must be explicitly referenced or in a PATH in your
# ~/.ssh/environment file (man ssh(1)).
# Default: fm = %(ROOTDIR)/sys/fm

#
# PYTHON command (specify alternate path)
# The fm script will be executed under the interpreter specified here.
# Default: python = python
#
# python = python2.4

#
# SSH command (specify alternate path or options)
# Note: for reduce operations to function, credential or agent forwarding must work
# Note: older versions of rsync don't support quoted arguments in the ssh command
# For improved performance use -S
# Default: ssh = ssh -o GSSAPIDelegateCredentials=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -Ax
#
#ssh = ssh -o GSSAPIDelegateCredentials=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ControlMaster=auto -S ~/.ssh/%l-%r@%h:%p -Ax

# RSYNC command (specify alternate path or options)
# Default: rsync = rsync -t
#
#rsync = /opt/local/bin/rsync -t

## List your nodes here.
## The [Nodename] should be unique, but is not used.
## If a 'hostname' is specified, then this is a remote host and 
## the given hostname must be accessible from all nodes.
## Most of the global settings can be over-ridden with per-node values.
